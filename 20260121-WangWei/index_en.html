        <div class="card-body">
          <ul>
            <li>The concept of a "three-second gust" is largely a non-technical construct, born more from past engineers' assumptions about the characteristics of observing instruments (especially the Dines anemometer) than from rigorous physical principles.</li>

          <h2>Conclusion</h2>
        </div>
        <div class="card-body">
          <p>This study reveals that the term "three-second gust" is largely a non-technical construct, deriving significantly from historical perceptions of anemometer system response characteristics. Its adoption was driven by the cooperation of multiple scientific and technical communities and standardization by the WMO. However, while the concept was partially justified retroactively by the aerodynamic characteristics of buildings, its origins are not based on strict physical laws. With the advancements in modern measurement technology allowing for the accurate recording of shorter-duration gusts, the fixed three-second standard may underestimate the maximum wind loads on smaller structures. Therefore, a re-evaluation of gust definition and measurement methods is warranted in future research and practice.</p>
          <ul>
            <li>The "three-second gust" is a concept born from historical perceptions of instrument performance rather than technical rationale.</li>
            <li>Standardization of this term was advanced by cooperation across multiple fields (wind engineering, meteorology, aviation) and recommendation by the WMO.</li>
            <li>As modern observation technologies can capture shorter gusts, the "three-second" standard may not be optimal for assessing impacts, especially on smaller structures.</li>

        </div>
          <div class="card-body">
            <p>The main content of the meeting is a review and discussion of a paper on the definition, historical background, and engineering validity of the <strong>"3-second peak gust"</strong>. The key points are summarized below.</p><h3>1. Definition and Background of 3-Second Average Wind Speed</h3><ul><li>Peak gust ($G$) is generally defined as the "maximum value of the 3-second average wind speed" and is calculated using the gust factor ($G_u$) and the 1-hour or 10-minute average wind speed.</li><li>The main reason for choosing the "3-second" duration is based on the <strong>response performance of anemometers and recording systems of the time (physical limitations of analog recorders)</strong> and the aerodynamic characteristics of obstacles such as buildings.</li><li>There is a background that past measurement systems could not record high-frequency turbulence, and it was physically possible to capture only fluctuations of about 2 to 3 seconds.</li></ul><h3>2. Technical Aspects of Filtering and Moving Average</h3><ul><li>Performing a moving average is an operation in the time domain, but in the frequency domain, it is synonymous with <strong>filtering that cuts high-frequency components</strong>.</li><li>Mathematically, it corresponds to filtering using the "sinc function", and the longer the averaging time ($T$), the more fine fluctuations are truncated.</li><li>Although the current observation system in Japan generally samples at 0.25-second intervals and outputs a 3-second moving average, it has been pointed out that historically it was merely treating the maximum output of the instrument as the "3-second value".</li></ul><h3>3. Engineering Validity and Issues</h3><ul><li><strong>Practical Convention:</strong> The 3-second standard was adapted from knowledge in the aviation field, and it is widely accepted as a <strong>practical convention rather than having a strong technical basis</strong>.</li><li><strong>Effect of Structure Size:</strong> While a 3-second duration may be sufficient for small-scale buildings, it may be <strong>too long for smaller structures and cladding</strong>, and a re-evaluation of the definition is necessary.</li><li><strong>Large-Scale Structures:</strong> Conversely, for large-scale structures such as huge towers, it may be necessary to consider wind speeds of longer duration.</li><li><strong>Future Proposals:</strong> For research purposes, it is recommended to archive high-frequency data (time-series data) and use a "gust duration" appropriate for the object, rather than relying on a fixed 3-second average.</li></ul><h3>4. Future Schedule</h3><ul><li><strong>Progress Report Meeting:</strong> Scheduled for January 28th from 13:00.</li><li><strong>Invitation of External Lecturer:</strong> In the afternoon of the same day, a professor from another university specializing in civil and ocean engineering will be invited for research sharing and discussion.</li><li><strong>Intensive Lecture:</strong> An intensive lecture by Dr. Shimura will be held on the 22nd and 23rd.</li></ul>

          <h3><strong>Study Group on 3-Second Average Peak Gust: Dialogue</strong></h3>
          <div class="transcript-entry">
            <div class="transcript-time">0:00 - 5:00: Introduction and Paper Summary</div>
            <div class="transcript-dialogue"><strong>Moderator:</strong> It seems Matsuda-kun and Sakai-kun are not here, but let's begin. It was originally scheduled for 9:00, but it has been moved to 10:00. Since there is another meeting from 13:00, I want to finish everyone's report even if we have to cut into our lunch break.</div>
            <div class="transcript-dialogue"><strong>Presenter:</strong> First, I will introduce a paper by Professor CW et al. on the <strong>"History of the 3-second peak gust"</strong>.</div>
            <div class="transcript-dialogue"><strong>Presenter:</strong> The peak gust ($G$) is defined by the maximum value of the 3-second average, the gust factor ($G_u$), and the 1-hour or 10-minute average wind speed. Why "3 seconds"? The paper mentions two concepts: <strong>anemometer response performance (speed of recording)</strong> and <strong>aerodynamic characteristics of structures (the scale at which gusts are felt)</strong>.</div>
          </div>
          <div class="transcript-entry">
            <div class="transcript-time">5:00 - 10:00: Historical Background and Measurement Technology</div>
            <div class="transcript-dialogue"><strong>Presenter:</strong> Old analog recorders, which used a physical pen to record on paper, could not capture high-frequency turbulence. The "3-second value" of that time was not a strict average calculation but rather the <strong>limit value that the instrument could output (performance maximum)</strong>.</div>
            <div class="transcript-dialogue"><strong>Presenter:</strong> By the way, what is the current observation system in Japan like?</div>
            <div class="transcript-dialogue"><strong>Student:</strong> <strong>According to Japanese meteorological observation regulations, it samples at 0.25-second intervals and outputs a 3-second moving average</strong>.</div>
            <div class="transcript-dialogue"><strong>Presenter:</strong> That's good information. Averaging in the time domain is mathematically a <strong>"convolution"</strong>, and in the frequency domain, it functions as a filter that cuts high frequencies.</div>
          </div>
          <div class="transcript-entry">
            <div class="transcript-time">10:00 - 15:00: Discussion of Mathematical Filtering</div>
            <div class="transcript-dialogue"><strong>Student (Sakai):</strong> (In Japanese) So, in the end, does it mean that high frequencies are dropped when you do a Fourier transform?</div>
            <div class="transcript-dialogue"><strong>Presenter:</strong> That's right. By taking a moving average, fine fluctuations are dropped.</div>
            <div class="transcript-dialogue"><strong>Presenter:</strong> Do you know where this filter function (sinc function) becomes zero? The average time $T$ corresponds to that zero point, and this operation makes high-frequency components disappear.</div>
          </div>
          <div class="transcript-entry">
            <div class="transcript-time">15:00 - 25:00: Engineering Validity and Application to Design</div>
            <div class="transcript-dialogue"><strong>Presenter:</strong> In the aviation field, a 3-second duration has been considered sufficient to envelop a small-scale building. However, this is a <strong>practical convention and does not necessarily have a strong technical basis</strong>.</div>
            <div class="transcript-dialogue"><strong>Student:</strong> How does the model react to very short gusts of less than 1 second?</div>
            <div class="transcript-dialogue"><strong>Presenter:</strong> As long as we use a moving average, they are excluded. Therefore, it has been proposed that <strong>3 seconds may be too long for small structures and cladding, and conversely, a longer duration should be considered for large-scale structures like huge towers</strong>.</div>
          </div>
          <div class="transcript-entry">
            <div class="transcript-time">25:00 - 30:00: Administrative Announcements and Closing</div>
            <div class="transcript-dialogue"><strong>Moderator:</strong> The next reports will be from Wan-san and Ton-san (or Fan-san).</div>
            <div class="transcript-dialogue"><strong>Moderator:</strong> <strong>There will be a report meeting on January 28th from 13:00</strong>. After that, we will invite a professor from Oita University specializing in civil and ocean engineering for a discussion.</div>
            <div class="transcript-dialogue"><strong>Moderator:</strong> Also, <strong>on January 22nd and 23rd, there will be an intensive lecture by Dr. Shimura</strong>. Fourth-year students should also register and attend.</div>
            <div class="transcript-dialogue"><strong>Presenter:</strong> That's all for today. Thank you very much.</div>

          <p>Review paper on the basis of the 3-second average in outdoor wind speed assessment:
The 3-second average started due to the limitations of observation equipment at the time the evaluation method was proposed, and it is not based on physical grounds. On the other hand, intuitively, when considering the influence on people and buildings, attempts have been made to explain it as a time scale with a physical basis by considering the length scale of the object and the velocity of the phenomenon at that time, but there was no solid basis from the beginning.</p>
