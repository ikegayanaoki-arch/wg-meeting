I understand the task. I will extract information from `20260121-WangWei/html/index.html`, create corresponding HTML snippets for `index.html`, `index_en.html`, and `index_ch.html`, and then update these main index files by adding the new content at the top of the table, updating the last modified timestamp, and ensuring links are correct.

First, I need to read the content of `20260121-WangWei/html/index.html`.
I've extracted the title, author, and journal from the provided `index.html` file. Now, I will prepare the HTML snippet for `index.html` with the report date 20260121, reporter WangWei, and a link to the report. To ensure proper insertion, I'll first read the existing `index.html` to understand its table structure.

I have the `index.html` structure. I will insert the new `<tr>` after `<tbody>`, add a `last-updated` script to the footer of `index.html`, ensuring the new entry is at the top. I will then replicate these changes for `index_en.html` and `index_ch.html`. I'll start with `index.html`, specifically by adding the `last-updated` script and element to its footer using the `replace` tool.
Footer updated. Now, I'll insert the new table row directly after the `<tbody>` tag in `index.html` to place it at the top.

I need to update `index_en.html`. I'll start by modifying the footer with "Last Updated" and an English locale timestamp. Then I will add the new table row for "History of the peak three-second gust" by WangWei, dated January 21, 2026, to the English version of the page.

I need to update `index_ch.html`. I'll first add the "最后更新" footer with a `zh-CN` locale timestamp. Then I will insert the new table row, including the link to `20260121-WangWei/html/index_ch.html`, the "WangWei" reporter, the paper title, author, and journal information.
