I understand the task. I will extract information from `20260121-WangWei/html/index.html`, create corresponding HTML snippets for `index.html`, `index_en.html`, and `index_ch.html`, and then update these main index files by adding the new content at the top of the table, updating the last modified timestamp, and ensuring links are correct.

First, I need to read the content of `20260121-WangWei/html/index.html`.
I've extracted the title, author, and journal from the provided `index.html` file. Now, I will prepare the HTML snippet for `index.html` with the report date 20260121, reporter WangWei, and a link to the report. To ensure proper insertion, I'll first read the existing `index.html` to understand its table structure.

I have the `index.html` structure. I will insert the new `<tr>` after `<tbody>`, add a `last-updated` script to the footer of `index.html`, ensuring the new entry is at the top. I will then replicate these changes for `index_en.html` and `index_ch.html`. I'll start with `index.html`, specifically by adding the `last-updated` script and element to its footer using the `replace` tool.
Footer updated. Now, I'll insert the new table row directly after the `<tbody>` tag in `index.html` to place it at the top.

Okay, I understand the task. I will extract information from `20260121-WangWei/index.html`, construct HTML table rows, and then update `index.html`, `index_en.html`, and `index_ch.html` by adding the new entry, updating timestamps, and ensuring the newest entry is at the top. I will not modify `run.sh`, `style.css`, or `html.md`.

Here's my plan:

1.  **Extract information from `20260121-WangWei/index.html`**:
    *   Read the content of `20260121-WangWei/index.html`.
    *   Identify the paper title, author, and publication journal from its content.
2.  **Generate the new table row (HTML snippet)**:
    *   Construct a `<tr>` element using the extracted data, including the report date (20260121), reporter (WangWei), and a link to the source HTML file.
3.  **Update `index.html`**:
    *   Read the current content of `index.html`.
    *   Insert the new table row at the top of the existing table rows.
    *   Update the "Last Updated" timestamp.
    *   Update the modification timestamp for the current entry.
4.  **Update `index_en.html`**:
    *   Read the current content of `index_en.html`.
    *   Insert the new table row (with appropriate English translations if needed for "Report Date", "Reporter", etc. based on the existing structure) at the top.
    *   Update the "Last Updated" timestamp.
    *   Update the modification timestamp for the current entry.
5.  **Update `index_ch.html`**:
    *   Read the current content of `index_ch.html`.
    *   Insert the new table row (with appropriate Chinese translations) at the top.
    *   Update the "Last Updated" timestamp.
    *   Update the modification timestamp for the current entry.

I'll start by reading `20260121-WangWei/index.html` to understand its structure and extract the necessary information.
I have extracted the following information from `20260121-WangWei/index.html`:

*   **Paper Title (English):** `History of the peak three-second gust`
*   **Author:** `Franklin T. Lombardo`
*   **Journal:** `Journal of Wind Engineering & Industrial Aerodynamics, Volume, 208, Pages 104447, 2021`

Now I will read the main `index.html` file to determine its structure and where to insert the new data.
I have analyzed the structure of `index.html` and identified where to insert the new table row and how to update the "Last Updated" timestamp.

Here's the plan for `index.html`:
1.  **Construct the new HTML table row (`<tr>`)**: This will contain the extracted data for the 2026.01.21 WangWei entry, formatted to match the existing table.
2.  **Locate the `<tbody>` section**: I will find the `<tbody>` tag and its closing `</tbody>` tag.
3.  **Insert the new row**: The new row will be inserted immediately after the opening `<tbody>` tag, ensuring it appears at the top of the table.
4.  **Update the footer timestamp**: I will find the line `<p>最終更新日時: 2026.01.27</p>` and update it to the current date if it's different. Given the problem statement, the date is already `2026.01.27`, so I will confirm this explicitly.

Now, I will perform the replacement for `index.html`.
`index.html` has been updated with the new entry. Now I need to update the "Last Updated" timestamp in its footer to `2026.01.27`.
Error executing tool replace: A secondary check by an LLM determined that no changes were necessary to fulfill the instruction. Explanation: The original search failed because the `replace` string was already present in the file, meaning the desired change (updating the date to 2026.01.27) had already been applied. No further changes are needed.. Original error with the parameters given: No changes to apply. The old_string and new_string are identical in file: /Users/ikegaya/programs/LLMWorkSpace/git/meeting.dev/index/index.html
The footer date in `index.html` is already correct. Now, I'll read `index_en.html` to understand its structure and English formatting for table rows and the "Last Updated" timestamp before making similar updates.
Attempt 1 failed: You have exhausted your capacity on this model. Your quota will reset after 2s.. Retrying after 2474.9276959999997ms...
I have analyzed the `index_en.html` file. I will construct the new English table row for the WangWei entry, insert it at the beginning of the `<tbody>` section, and ensure the "Last Updated" timestamp in the footer reflects the current date, "2026.01.27". I am now proceeding with the update of `index_en.html`.
`index_en.html` is updated. Time to update the "Last Updated" timestamp in its footer.

Footer replacement failed for `index_en.html` as the date was identical. Now, I'll read `index_ch.html` to understand its Chinese formatting for table rows and "Last Updated" timestamps before proceeding.
I have analyzed the `index_ch.html` file. I will construct the new Chinese table row for the WangWei entry, insert it at the beginning of the `<tbody>` section, and ensure the "最后更新" timestamp in the footer reflects the current date, "2026.01.27". I am now proceeding with the update of `index_ch.html`.
Attempt 1 failed: You have exhausted your capacity on this model. Your quota will reset after 1s.. Retrying after 1252.7465659999998ms...
`index_ch.html` updated. Now, update its footer timestamp.
Error executing tool replace: A secondary check by an LLM determined that no changes were necessary to fulfill the instruction. Explanation: The original search string correctly matched the content in the file. However, the `replace` string was identical to the `search` string, indicating that the requested change (updating the date to 2026.01.27) has already been applied to the file. Therefore, no changes are required.. Original error with the parameters given: No changes to apply. The old_string and new_string are identical in file: /Users/ikegaya/programs/LLMWorkSpace/git/meeting.dev/index/index_ch.html
The `index_ch.html` footer date is confirmed as `2026.01.27`. All three language versions of `index.html` have been updated with the new entry and their footer dates verified. The specified file modification constraints were respected. Task complete.

Okay, I understand the task. I need to update the `index.html`, `index_en.html`, and `index_ch.html` files by extracting information from `20260128-TongTingzhou/index.html`, creating a new table row, and inserting it into the main HTML tables, ensuring the newest entry is at the top. I also need to update the "最終更新日時" (Last Updated Time) in each file.

Here's the plan:

1.  **Read `20260128-TongTingzhou/index.html`**: Extract the paper title, author, and journal.
2.  **Generate HTML Snippets**: Create the `<tr>...</tr>` rows for Japanese, English, and Chinese versions.
3.  **Update `index.html`**:
    *   Read the existing `index.html`.
    *   Find the table and insert the new Japanese HTML snippet at the correct position (newest on top).
    *   Update the "最終更新日時" with the current timestamp.
4.  **Update `index_en.html`**:
    *   Read the existing `index_en.html`.
    *   Find the table and insert the new English HTML snippet.
    *   Update the "Last Updated Time".
5.  **Update `index_ch.html`**:
    *   Read the existing `index_ch.html`.
    *   Find the table and insert the new Chinese HTML snippet.
    *   Update the "最后更新时间".

I will start by reading `20260128-TongTingzhou/index.html` to extract the required information.
Okay, I have the extracted data. Now I'll create the HTML snippets for Japanese, English, and Chinese, then read `index.html` to prepare for insertion and timestamp updates.
