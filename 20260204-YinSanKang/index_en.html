            </div>
            <div class="card-body">
                <p>Using field data from a coastal site, we explored the turbulence spectra of boundary layer flows over land and sea, focusing on the occurrence and characteristics of the -1 spectral scaling in the energy production region. Results reveal that the interaction of the flow with surface roughness is a critical factor influencing the extent of the -1 scaling. Flows over the sea under generally calm conditions consistently exhibited a robust -1 spectral scaling across times of day and seasons. In contrast, flows over land, encountering higher surface roughness and heterogeneity, display very limited -1 scaling. Inspection of turbulence intermittency showed sea winds with slightly higher intermittency, though both remain lower. Also, spectral normalization using the integral wave number provides a general trend in the spectra well across heights and flow conditions onto a general trend, highlighting the potential role of the integral scale in spectral behavior. These insights maybe instrumental for atmospheric modeling, wind energy systems, and pollutant dispersion.</p>

                <img src="image.png" alt="Meeting Highlights Image" style="width:100%;">
                <p>This summary provides a more in-depth overview of the latter half of the meeting (from detailed research presentations to Q&A and future plans), based on the provided source material.</p>
<h3>2. Details of the Paper Presentation: Surface Roughness and Wind Spectral Characteristics</h3>
<p><p>This study focuses on the <strong>"-1 power law" scaling in the energy-containing range</strong>. While the Kolmogorov "-5/3 power law" is well-known for atmospheric boundary layer spectra, this research investigates the characteristics of the preceding range.</p><p>*   <strong>Observation Conditions and Data Selection:</strong><br>    *   Approximately 30 samples were selected from a meteorological observation tower.<br>    *   The analysis focused exclusively on <strong>neutral stability conditions</strong>, which refer to a state where the heat exchange (heat flux) between the ground and the atmosphere is nearly zero.<br>*   <strong>Significant Differences between Sea Wind and Land Wind:</strong><br>    *   Under sea wind conditions, the region exhibiting the <strong>"-1 power law" was significantly broader and more clearly defined</strong> compared to land wind.<br>    *   This is attributed to the sea surface being much smoother than land (e.g., vegetation).<br>*   <strong>Robustness of Characteristics:</strong><br>    *   <strong>Time of Day:</strong> The -1 region was consistently observed throughout the day, regardless of morning, afternoon, evening, or night.<br>    *   <strong>Season:</strong> Similar scaling characteristics were maintained throughout the year, including data from February, April, October, and December.<br>    *   <strong>Transition Indicator:</strong> The characteristic frequency (&#36;f_u&#36;), which is the reciprocal of the integral time scale, consistently lies within this -1 region, indicating the <strong>onset of a transition</strong> from large-scale to small-scale structures.</p>
<h3>3. Discussion on Analysis Methods and Physical Interpretation</h3>
<p><p>The meeting included a deep discussion on why this scaling develops in smooth sea winds and how to eliminate the influence of altitude.</p><p>*   <strong>Influence of Altitude and Normalization:</strong><br>    *   As measurement altitude increases, the -1 region tends to expand towards lower frequencies.<br>    *   However, by converting frequencies to wavelengths and normalizing them using the mean wind speed (&#36;U&#36;) and integral length scale (&#36;K_I&#36;) at each altitude, it was confirmed that <strong>the peak positions align, and a consistent trend is obtained even under different altitudes and wind conditions (sea/land)</strong>.<br>*   <strong>Interpretation based on the "Attached Eddy Hypothesis":</strong><br>    *   "Attached eddies" constrained by the wall (ground surface) follow the energy cascade (&#36;-5/3&#36; power law), but in layers where <strong>"detached eddies"</strong>, which are unaffected by the ground, are dominant, energy is uniformly distributed across each frequency, and the spectrum becomes flat (&#36;-1&#36; region).<br>    *   It is thought that sea winds, due to their lower roughness, exhibit the characteristics of these detached eddies more strongly, resulting in a wider -1 region.<br>*   <strong>System Complexity and Intermittency:</strong><br>    *   Analysis using structure functions and fractal dimensions suggested that <strong>sea winds exhibit higher intermittency and are more complex and difficult to predict as a system than land winds</strong>.</p>
<h3>4. Observation Environment and Technical Details</h3>
<p><p>During the Q&A, additional background information on the data used in the paper was provided.</p><p>*   <strong>Specific Examples of Surface Roughness:</strong> The land side of the observation site was an rural-like environment with vegetation about 1m high (roughness length &#36;z_0 pprox 0.1m&#36;), while the sea side was a nearly flat water surface (&#36;z_0 pprox 10^{-4}m&#36;).<br>*   <strong>Observation Equipment Configuration:</strong> An expensive <strong>3D ultrasonic anemometer</strong> was installed only at the top of the data collection (approx. 12m), while others were 2D. This was because vertical component data was needed at least at one point to calculate heat flux (stability). Although the data itself is about 15 years old, the analysis methods applied are up-to-date.</p>
<h3>5. Future Schedule (Reconfirmation)</h3>
<p><p>Finally, the busy end-of-fiscal-year schedule was reconfirmed.</p><p>*   <strong>February 10 (Tuesday) 10:00 AM:</strong> Progress report meeting (no paper reading). All reports are scheduled to be completed by the afternoon group meeting.<br>*   <strong>February 12 & 13:</strong> Master's thesis defense.<br>*   <strong>February 16 (Monday):</strong><br>    *   Afternoon: Undergraduate student poster presentation (held in Building D).<br>    *   After conclusion: Continuation of progress reports for non-graduating students.</p>

    <span class="speaker">Professor</span>
    <div class="dialog"><p>Good work, everyone. Well, the academic year is drawing to a close, and graduating students have many deadlines approaching. <strong>Today is the last paper reading session of the academic year.</strong> The next one will resume in April with the new academic year. For non-graduating students, please continue reporting your progress to me on a fixed day each week. Next week, we have the Master's thesis defenses and undergraduate poster presentations. To understand what other students are doing, I encourage non-graduating students to participate as well. Once lectures are over, spring break will begin, but if you plan to take time off, please consult with me beforehand. Let's begin.</p></div>
</div>
<div class="transcript-entry">
    <div class="time">05:00 - 15:00</div>
    <span class="speaker">Presenter</span>
    <div class="dialog"><p>Yes. Today, I'll be presenting a paper titled "On the Surface Roughness Effects on −1 Spectral Scaling in Atmospheric Boundary Layer." In classical knowledge, spectra are divided into three regions: the energy-containing range, the inertial subrange, and the dissipation range. This study focuses on the <strong>-1 power law scaling</strong> in the energy-containing range. Specifically, it investigates how wind direction under neutral stability conditions affects this. The data used consists of approximately 30 samples obtained from a meteorological observation tower.</p></div>
</div>
<div class="transcript-entry">
    <div class="time">05:00 - 15:00</div>
    <span class="speaker">Professor</span>
    <div class="dialog"><p>Are "30 samples" referring to the dataset? Also, could you explain the meaning of "Monin-Obukhov length (L)"?</p></div>
</div>
<div class="transcript-entry">
    <div class="time">05:00 - 15:00</div>
    <span class="speaker">Presenter</span>
    <div class="dialog"><p>Yes, it's an indicator calculated from friction velocity and heat flux (&#36;w'	heta'&#36;).</p></div>
</div>
<div class="transcript-entry">
    <div class="time">05:00 - 15:00</div>
    <span class="speaker">Professor</span>
    <div class="dialog"><p>So, if the denominator's heat flux is negative, it's stable, and if it's positive (when the ground is heated and there's an updraft), it's unstable, right? Is the subject of this research <strong>neutral conditions</strong>, where this value is close to zero?</p></div>
</div>
<div class="transcript-entry">
    <div class="time">05:00 - 15:00</div>
    <span class="speaker">Presenter</span>
    <div class="dialog"><p>That's correct. For both sea and land winds, we've selected nearly neutral conditions.</p></div>
</div>
<div class="transcript-entry">
    <div class="time">15:00 - 30:00</div>
    <span class="speaker">Presenter</span>
    <div class="dialog"><p>As a result of analyzing the wind speed spectrum at an altitude of approximately 12m, it was found that under <strong>sea wind conditions, the region exhibiting the -1 power law was broader and more distinct than under land wind conditions.</strong></p></div>
</div>
<div class="transcript-entry">
    <div class="time">15:00 - 30:00</div>
    <span class="speaker">Professor</span>
    <div class="dialog"><p>I see. Looking at the "Premultiplied spectrum" with frequency on the horizontal axis, the energy-containing region is broader (wideband) for sea winds, isn't it? Do the authors believe this is due to differences in surface roughness?</p></div>
</div>
<div class="transcript-entry">
    <div class="time">15:00 - 30:00</div>
    <span class="speaker">Presenter</span>
    <div class="dialog"><p>Yes, because the roughness of the sea surface is smaller than that of land. Furthermore, this -1 region was observed consistently throughout the day, regardless of morning, afternoon, or night, suggesting it is a very <strong>robust phenomenon</strong>.</p></div>
</div>
<div class="transcript-entry">
    <div class="time">15:00 - 30:00</div>
    <span class="speaker">Professor</span>
    <div class="dialog"><p>How about seasonal differences?</p></div>
</div>
<div class="transcript-entry">
    <div class="time">15:00 - 30:00</div>
    <span class="speaker">Presenter</span>
    <div class="dialog"><p>Similar results were obtained from data in February, April, October, and December, showing robustness throughout the year. Also, the characteristic frequency (&#36;f_u&#36;), which is the reciprocal of the integral time scale, is always located within this -1 region. This is thought to signify the beginning of the <strong>transition range</strong> from large-scale to small-scale structures.</p></div>
</div>
<div class="transcript-entry">
    <div class="time">30:00 - 45:00</div>
    <span class="speaker">Student A</span>
    <div class="dialog"><p>Does the shape of the spectrum not change with altitude?</p></div>
</div>
<div class="transcript-entry">
    <div class="time">30:00 - 45:00</div>
    <span class="speaker">Presenter</span>
    <div class="dialog"><p>As altitude increases (e.g., 50m), the -1 region on the low-frequency side tends to expand.</p></div>
</div>
<div class="transcript-entry">
    <div class="time">30:00 - 45:00</div>
    <span class="speaker">Professor</span>
    <div class="dialog"><p>When normalized using mean wind speed and integral length scale (&#36;K_I&#36;), the peak positions align and a consistent trend is observed even at different altitudes, isn't it? By the way, is there a physical explanation for why the -1 region is broader for sea winds (smooth surfaces)?</p></div>
</div>
<div class="transcript-entry">
    <div class="time">30:00 - 45:00</div>
    <span class="speaker">Presenter</span>
    <div class="dialog"><p>The paper explains that energy is not immediately cascaded (transferred) from large eddies to small eddies, and a transition process exists. There is also an interpretation based on the <strong>"Attached Eddy Hypothesis."</strong></p></div>
</div>
<div class="transcript-entry">
    <div class="time">30:00 - 45:00</div>
    <span class="speaker">Professor</span>
    <div class="dialog"><p>So, "attached eddies" constrained by the wall follow the -5/3 power law (cascade), but in layers where <strong>"detached eddies"</strong> that are not directly affected by the ground exist isotropically, the spectrum becomes flat (the -1 power law region), is that right? Sea winds, due to their lower roughness, may exhibit the characteristics of these detached eddies more strongly.</p></div>
</div>
<div class="transcript-entry">
    <div class="time">45:00 - 55:00</div>
    <span class="speaker">Presenter</span>
    <div class="dialog"><p>Finally, analysis using structure functions showed that <strong>sea winds exhibit higher "intermittency" than land winds and are more complex as a system, making them more difficult to predict.</strong></p></div>
</div>
<div class="transcript-entry">
    <div class="time">45:00 - 55:00</div>
    <span class="speaker">Student B</span>
    <div class="dialog"><p>I have a question about the observation equipment. Why was only the uppermost part equipped with a 3D ultrasonic anemometer, while the others were 2D?</p></div>
</div>
<div class="transcript-entry">
    <div class="time">45:00 - 55:00</div>
    <span class="speaker">Professor</span>
    <div class="dialog"><p>That's probably a budget issue. 3D ones are more expensive. A vertical component is necessary to calculate heat flux (stability), so at least one location needs to be 3D. Although the data itself is about 15 years old, the analysis methods are new.</p></div>
</div>
<div class="transcript-entry">
    <div class="time">55:00 - 60:00</div>
    <span class="speaker">Professor</span>
    <div class="dialog"><p>That was a good presentation. Finally, let me confirm next week's schedule.<br>*   <strong>February 10 (Tuesday) 10:00 AM:</strong> Progress report meeting (no paper reading).<br>*   <strong>February 12 & 13:</strong> Master's thesis defense.<br>*   <strong>February 16 (Monday):</strong><br>    *   Afternoon: Undergraduate student poster presentation (to be held in Building D).<br>    *   After conclusion: Continuation of progress reports for non-graduating students.<br>I will share the details later.

<ul><li>Explanation of the characteristic where energy cascade does not occur, and attenuation is proportional to the inverse of frequency (a -1 power law).</li></ul><br>Presenter: Yin Sankag
<ul><li>This paper analyzed a characteristic of spectra observed in coastal outdoor observation data, where the energy intensity attenuates with the inverse of frequency (a -1 power law). This means that for each frequency, energy is uniformly distributed, creating a plateau region where no energy cascade occurs.</li><li>Observations were conducted in a coastal region of Mexico, combining 3D and 2D ultrasonic anemometers on a tower at heights of 4m, 12m, 20m, and 50m, measuring wind speed on a daily basis. A total of 20 datasets were analyzed.</li><li>In boundary layer flows, eddies influenced by the surface, known as attached eddies, undergo energy scaling due to the field of view, where energy is exchanged from large eddies to small eddies. In this case, the spectrum exhibits a -5/3 power law decay. On the other hand, in cases like flows over the sea, where the surface roughness is sufficiently small and the boundary number is large, detached eddies, which are not influenced by the surface, allow energy to be uniformly distributed across various frequencies. As a result, when viewed in spectral space, energy attenuates with the inverse of frequency (a -1 power law), meaning a region with uniform energy intensity (F-type energy intensity) becomes active. This region corresponds to a transition region where the energy cascade is about to occur.</li></ul>
<ul><li>I found it very beneficial that this report presented a paper analyzing the characteristics of actual wind from outdoor observations, as our laboratory primarily deals with CFD or experimental studies. The content was concisely summarized, and the presentation was easy to understand. The presenter handled questions very well. I learned something new about the energy transition region, where energy intensity attenuates with the inverse of frequency, which was very educational.</li></ul>
